# Image Assets for Onboarding

- Format: PNG (for best quality) or JPG
- Recommended size: 400x400px or larger to show full analytics
- File size: Keep under 500KB
- Content: A screenshot of your savings/analytics screen

**What to capture:**
- The savings dashboard or analytics view from your app
- Make sure it shows the key features (charts, statistics, insights)
- Clean, readable interface that represents the feature well

**Display:**
- Width: 280px, height: up to 450px (auto-scales)
- Rounded corners (12px radius)
- Subtle shadow for depth

## 2. Smart Shopping Lists Animation

To add an animated GIF for the "Smart Shopping Lists" feature:

**Animation Recommendations:**
- Format: GIF (animated)
- Recommended size: 300x300px (square format)
- File size: Keep under 2MB for smooth loading
- Content: Two friends holding hands or shaking hands
- Animation: Smooth, friendly, signifying shared/collaborative shopping

**What to look for:**
- Friendly, warm illustration style
- Clear representation of collaboration/sharing
- Loops seamlessly
- Not too fast or distracting

**Display:**
- 180x180px container
- Centered in the green background card
- Will loop automatically

## Fallback:
If either image file is missing or fails to load, it will automatically fall back to showing emoji icons (ðŸ“Š for savings, ðŸ›’ for shopping).
